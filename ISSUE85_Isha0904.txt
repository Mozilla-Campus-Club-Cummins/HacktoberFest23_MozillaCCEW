Algorithm to convert Infix expression into Postfix expression using Stack Data Structure (JAVA)

1. Start
2. Scan the infix expression from Left to Right.
3. Check if the character is an Operand
	3.1 Pop the character.
4. If the character is a Left parenthesis 
	4.1 If the character is ‘(‘
		4.1.1 Push the character into Stack
	4.2 If the character is ‘)’
		4.2.1 Pop all the characters out of stack until ‘(‘ occurs again.
5. If the character is a regular Operator
	5.1 If the ICP (In-Coming Priority of operator) > ISP (In-Stack Priority of operator)
		5.1.1 Push the operator in the Stack
	5.2 Else
		5.2.1 Pop the operators until ICP <= ISP using while loop
6. When all the characters in Infix Expression are processed, repeatedly pop the characters out of stack and display it.
7. Stop
